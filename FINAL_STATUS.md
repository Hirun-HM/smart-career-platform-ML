cd server && dotnet run --urls="http://localhost:5002"

# Terminal 3: Frontend
cd client && npm run dev
```

### Using Startup Scripts
```bash
# Start all services with individual scripts:
./start-ml-service.sh      # Starts ML service on port 5001
./start-server.sh          # Starts backend on port 5002  
./start-client.sh          # Starts frontend on port 3000
```

## 🔍 Testing the System

### 1. Frontend Interface
- Open: http://localhost:3000
- Navigate through the landing page
- Test the course recommendation components

### 2. API Endpoints
```bash
# Test backend skills
curl http://localhost:5002/api/skills

# Test ML service health
curl http://localhost:5001/health

# Test course recommendations
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"user_id": 1, "user_skills": ["JavaScript", "Python"], "user_experience": 2}' \
     http://localhost:5001/recommend-courses
```

### 3. Full End-to-End Test
